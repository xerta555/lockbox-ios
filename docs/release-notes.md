# Release Notes

## 1.0 (Build 1280)

What's NEW? We polished the interface (colors!), squashed some bugs (lock timer!), and improved the experience for those users (unsafely!) using a device without a passcode. If your app appears empty, there is one good reason and we're working on it but check your email for a confirmation link.

This build DOES include:

- signing in with Firefox Accounts to see your real "Saved Logins" data from Firefox
- automatic locking with biometrics (Touch ID / Face ID) to prevent access to your data
- searching and sorting items
- user-friendly item titles to help with readability
- showing/hiding passwords
- copying usernames and passwords to the pasteboard (which expire after 60 seconds)
- opening web addresses in your preferred web browser
- meaningful instructions when you have no items found
- Telemetry for event tracking (no personally-identifiable information is collected)

This build DOES NOT include:

- an alert when we're stuck waiting on you to confirm your Firefox Accounts sign in (#417)
- a few more links to real FAQ content and instructions (#172)
- creating, updating or deleting entries (that's intentional)

## 1.0 (Build 1189)

What's NEW? We squashed a bunch of bugs (timed locking works much better now) and added a few improvements (user-friendly titles and a sync indicator that doesn't interrupt you). To recap...

This build DOES include:

- signing in with Firefox Accounts to see your real "Saved Logins" data from Firefox
- automatic locking with biometrics (Touch ID / Face ID) to prevent access to your data
- searching and sorting items
- user-friendly item titles to help with readability
- showing/hiding passwords
- copying usernames and passwords to the pasteboard (which expire after 60 seconds)

This build DOES NOT include:

- links to real FAQ content (#172 and #340)
- meaningful instructions when no items are found (#44)

Some KNOWN ISSUES include:

- you may sign in and receive a "confirmation" email but the app wont tell you that you need to go find that email, thus your list appears empty - please go find that email (#328)
- if you delete the app and re-install it, your app may crash once (#374)
- the autolocking timer was working inconsistently and may not have automatically locked the app, please keep testing this!

## 1.0 (Build 1128)

_Date: 2018-05-14_

This build DOES include: signing in with Firefox Accounts to see your real "Saved Logins" data from Firefox; automatic locking with biometrics (Touch ID / Face ID) to prevent access to your data; searching and sorting items; showing/hiding passwords; copying usernames and passwords to the pasteboard (which expire after 60 seconds); opening web addresses in your preferred web browser; Telemetry for event tracking (no personally-identifiable information is collected).

This build DOES NOT include: user-friendly item titles (#193); links to real FAQ content (#172 and #340); proper visual placeholders when an initial sync is occurring (#233) or when no items are found (#44).

Some KNOWN ISSUES include: you may sign in and get a "confirmation" email, the app doesn't tell you that you need to go find that email so your list appears empty - go find that email and "Confirm" your sign ins, please (#328); the autolock timer doesn't automatically lock your app (#356); when navigating away from the list view and a sync occurs in the background the app will pop you back into the list view (#347); the search/filter keyboard is immediately dismissed after the first and second character you type (#351). Don't worry, we'll get these fixed soon!

Please also note: the app may crash on first run â€” just open it again and please let us know if you encounter this or anything unexpected. We believe we squashed all kinds of bugs related to first run and sign in but need your help making sure.
